* About
I'm Adam. I'm the lead software developer at webeo. I also write code for fun
and sometimes have opinions about things. If they're interesting enough I might
write about them here. Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong, this is the internet
after all.

The code for this site is available here, and if you're interested in how I
write and publish it, I've written about it here.
